Food Donation Matching App

Project Overview
This project was built for *MEALINK* during a hackathon.  
It is a simple but impactful web site that connects donors (restaurants, canteens, households) with NGOs / needy communities for donating surplus food.  

Features
- *Donate Food* → Donors can post available surplus food.  
- *View Donations* → NGOs can see available food donations.  
- *Register NGOs* → NGOs can register with their name and location.  
- *Find Matches* → NGOs can view the most suitable donations based on location & food type.  
- *Hackathon Ready* → Lightweight (no external DB needed).  
- *Mobile Access* → Can be viewed on phone via USB or Wi-Fi.  

Tech Stack:
Frontend (Website UI): Responsive, AI-assisted website design (HTML, CSS, JS) for donor & NGO interaction.
Backend (APIs): FastAPI
 – manages donations, NGOs, and matching endpoints.
Database: In-memory (Python lists/dictionaries) – lightweight storage for hackathon prototyping (can scale to MongoDB/Postgres later).
Optional AI (future-ready): Ollama
 + RAG + VectorDB (FAISS/MongoDB Atlas) for AI-powered matching & chatbot support.
