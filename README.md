MEALINK


Project Overview

This project was built for SDG 2 â€“ Zero Hunger during a hackathon.
It is a simple yet impactful web application that connects donors (restaurants, canteens, households) with NGOs / needy communities to distribute surplus food efficiently. The app reduces food waste while ensuring food reaches those who need it most.

Features:

->Donate Food â†’ Donors can post details of surplus food.

->View Donations â†’ NGOs can view all available food items.

->Register NGOs â†’ NGOs can sign up with name & location.

->Smart Matching â†’ NGOs can find the most relevant food donations based on type & location.

->Lightweight & Hackathon-ready â†’ Runs without a heavy database.

->Mobile Access â†’ Can be accessed on phone via USB or Wi-Fi.

ðŸ›  Tech Stack

Frontend (Website UI): Responsive web interface (HTML, CSS, JS) for donor & NGO interaction.

Backend (APIs): FastAPI
 â€“ REST APIs to manage donations, NGOs, and matches.

Database: In-memory (Python lists/dictionaries) â€“ lightweight storage (can later scale to MongoDB/Postgres).

Optional AI (future-ready): Ollama
 + RAG + VectorDB (FAISS/MongoDB Atlas) for intelligent NGOâ€“donation matching and chatbot support.
